Dear Samar Ertsey,

I said it was not the answer you were looking for because you requested to have International Membership. In applying, the answer you were looking for was clearly yes. I am afraid the answer is that it is not possible.

Unless you can work things out with German YM, there is no formal way that you can enter into membership.

I am not familiar with mediation services in Germany. I suggest that you approach German YM and see if they would be willing to engage in a process of mediation with you, and then explore who might be acceptable mediators. If they won't, then you will have to live your Quaker witness outside the formal structure of membership, as thousands of Friends around the world do (included hundreds here in Britain).

BTW, there is only one YM in Britain.

In Friendship,
